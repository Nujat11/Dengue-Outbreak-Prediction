# Dengue-Outbreak-Prediction

This project presents a machine learning approach to predict dengue outbreaks in Bangladesh using climate data. The study applies a Simple Linear Regression model to analyze the relationship between weather variables (rainfall, temperature, and humidity) and annual dengue cases.

Using historical dengue and meteorological data, the model evaluates performance through MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics. Results show that rainfall is the strongest predictor of dengue outbreaks, achieving an R² score of 0.97, indicating a strong linear relationship between rainfall and dengue incidence.

This project serves as a transparent and interpretable baseline model for dengue prediction and highlights the potential of weather-driven early warning systems to support public health decision-making.
